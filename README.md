This repository contains some code I wrote while learning Python.

## Table of Content:
* [**Armstrong Numbers**](armstrong.py) - determines whether a number is an Armstrong Number and returns the result in a whole sentence "The Number is \[not\] an Armstrong number."

## [Armstrong](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/armstrong.py)
Determine if a number is an [Armstrong number](https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs201/NOTES/chap04/arms.html) or not
> An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer such that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.

## [Bank](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/bank.py)
Create and manage a bank account in the terminal    

## [Breadth First Search (BFS)](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/bfs.py)
Traversing Graph using Breadth First Search
> Breadth First Search is similar to Breadth First Traversal of a tree, 
the only difference is that in Graph we have to maintain list of visited node as it may
contain cycle(s).  
    

## [Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/gcd.py)
Calculate the [Greatest Common Divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) between 2 numbers

## [Least Common Multiple (LCM)](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/lcm.py)
Calculate the [Least Common Multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) between 2 numbers

## [Odd or Even](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/oddeven.py)
Check whether given number is odd or even

## [Palindrome](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/palindrome.py)
Evaluate if a number is a palindrome or not

## [Summation of 1 to n](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/sumofn.py)
Calculate the sum from 1 to n numbers

1 + 2 + 3 + ........ (up to n)

## [Summation of square series](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/sumofsquares.py)
Calculate the sum of squares from 1 to n numbers

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + ........ (up to n<sup>2</sup>)     

## [Summation of cube series](https://github.com/rossoskull/python-beginner/blob/master/sumofcubes.py)
Calculate the sum of cubes from 1 to n numbers

1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + ........ (up to n<sup>3</sup>)
