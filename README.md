# Python-Beginner
The following are python scripts I wrote while learning how to program in Python.

**armstrong.py** This script checks whether the input is an [Armstrong Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85ngstr%C3%B6m) or not.

**bank.py** This script creates a banking application where users can create accounts and carry out transactions.

**gcd.py** This script calculates the greatest common denominator between two input numbers.

**lcm.py** This script calculates the least common multiple between two input numbers.

**oddeven.py** This script receives a number input and figures out whether the value is odd or even.

**palindrome.py** This script checks whether the input is a palindrome, i.e. it reads the same backwards as it does forwards.

**sumofn.oy** This script receives a number n as input and calculates the sum of all integers from 1 up to and including the value n.

**sumofsquares.py** This script receives a number n as input and calculates the sum of all squares of integers from 1 up to and including the value n.
